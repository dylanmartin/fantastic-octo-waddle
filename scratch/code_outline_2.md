### Step 1: **Enhancing the WorkflowController**

We'll enhance the `WorkflowController` to include a second broadcast-and-wait step that sends the compiled results back to the sites so they can save them locally.

#### **1.1 Updated WorkflowController Class**

```python
class WorkflowController:
    def __init__(self, site_paths: List[str]):
        self.site_paths = site_paths
        self.aggregator = CentralAggregator()
        self.site_results = {}
        self.combined_result = None

    def broadcast_and_wait(self, task_name: str, shareable: dict) -> None:
        """
        Broadcast a task to all sites and wait for their results.
        """
        for site in self.site_paths:
            print(f"Broadcasting task '{task_name}' to site: {site}")
            site_result = self._run_site_task(task_name, site, shareable)
            self._accept_site_result(site, site_result)

    def _run_site_task(self, task_name: str, site: str, shareable: dict) -> Union[SiteResult, None]:
        """
        Run the specified task on a site.
        """
        if task_name == "perform_regression":
            data_loader = SiteDataLoader()
            regressor = LocalRegressor()
            data = data_loader.load_site_data(site)
            site_result = regressor.fit_model(data)
            return site_result
        elif task_name == "save_results":
            output_generator = OutputGenerator()
            output_generator.save_output(shareable, f'{site}/local_regression_results.json')
            return None
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown task name: {task_name}")

    def _accept_site_result(self, site: str, site_result: SiteResult) -> None:
        """
        Feed the site results into the aggregator.
        """
        print(f"Accepting result from site: {site}")
        self.site_results[site] = site_result
        self.combined_result = self.aggregator.aggregate_results(self.site_results)

    def compile_and_save_results(self, output_path: str) -> None:
        """
        Compile results and save them centrally.
        """
        compiler = ResultCompiler()
        final_output = compiler.compile_output(self.site_results, self.combined_result)
        output_generator = OutputGenerator()
        output_generator.save_output(final_output, output_path)
        return final_output

    def broadcast_final_results(self, final_output: RegressionOutput) -> None:
        """
        Broadcast the compiled results back to the sites for local saving.
        """
        self.broadcast_and_wait("save_results", final_output)
```

### Step 2: **Revised Main Script with Final Results Broadcast**

```python
def main():
    site_paths = ['/site1', '/site2', '/site3']  # Example site paths
    controller = WorkflowController(site_paths)
    
    # Step 1: Perform regression and collect results from sites
    shareable = {}  # Any necessary data for the initial task
    controller.broadcast_and_wait("perform_regression", shareable)
    
    # Step 2: Compile and save the final results centrally
    final_output = controller.compile_and_save_results('central_regression_results.json')
    
    # Step 3: Broadcast the final results back to the sites for local saving
    controller.broadcast_final_results(final_output)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Updated Components:

1. **`broadcast_and_wait(task_name, shareable)`**:
   - This method has been extended to handle both performing regression tasks and saving results locally at each site.

2. **`_run_site_task(task_name, site, shareable)`**:
   - Now supports the `save_results` task, which saves the compiled results back to each site. The `shareable` in this case is the `final_output` that was compiled centrally.

3. **`broadcast_final_results(final_output)`**:
   - This new method is responsible for broadcasting the compiled results back to all sites, where they will be saved locally.

### Summary:

- The `WorkflowController` now manages an additional step in the workflow where it sends the compiled results back to the sites.
- This design ensures that each site not only performs its regression task but also receives and saves the aggregated results, maintaining a decentralized yet synchronized workflow.
- The overall process remains clean, modular, and easy to follow, with the controller orchestrating all key tasks and communications.
