### 1. **Simulate Federated Environment**:
   - **Site Isolation**: Treat each site's data as if it were located on a different node or machine. Even though all data is on one machine, keep the data for each site isolated in its respective directory (`/site1`, `/site2`, `/site3`, etc.).
   - **Data Access Control**: Implement a mechanism to simulate restricted access to each site’s data. Each site’s data should only be accessible when its processing is in progress.

### 2. **Local Model Setup**:
   - **Define the Regression Model**: For each site, set up a local instance of the regression model. This could be done in separate processes or using isolated functions to mimic the decentralized nature of federated learning.

### 3. **Local Site-Specific Regression**:
   - **Load and Process Data per Site**: For each site, load the `covariates.csv` and `data.csv` files into memory and fit the regression model.
   - **Extract Results**: Extract the regression coefficients, p-values, R-squared, and residuals for each site.
   - **Store Local Results**: Store these results locally within the site-specific scope, ensuring no data is shared between sites at this stage.

### 4. **Centralized Aggregation (Simulating Federated Server)**:
   - **Aggregate Results**: Once all sites have completed their local regression, aggregate the results on the central node (your machine). This step simulates the federated learning server aggregating model updates.
   - **Combine Models**: Use the aggregated site-specific results to calculate combined metrics such as pooled coefficients, pooled p-values, overall R-squared, and adjusted R-squared.
   - **Store Combined Results**: Store the combined results in a `CombinedResult` dataclass.

### 5. **Simulate Federated Communication**:
   - **Model Update Simulation (Optional)**: If desired, simulate sending model updates back to each site (i.e., combined model coefficients) and refit models locally. This step isn't necessary unless you are mimicking federated learning more closely.

### 6. **Result Compilation**:
   - **Create `RegressionOutput` Object**: Combine the site-specific results and the combined results into the `RegressionOutput` dataclass.
   - **Output/Save Results**: You can either print, log, or save these results to a file (e.g., JSON, CSV) for further analysis.

### 7. **Error Handling and Validation**:
   - **Simulate Federated Errors**: Implement error handling as if each site could fail independently, ensuring that a failure in one site doesn't affect the others.
   - **Validate Results**: Perform basic checks on the output to ensure the model has run correctly.

### 8. **Visualization (Optional)**:
   - **Residual Plots**: Generate residual plots for each site to visually inspect the model fit.
   - **Coefficient Comparison**: Create visualizations comparing coefficients across sites.

### 9. **Documentation and Cleanup**:
   - **Document the Process**: Ensure that each step is well-documented, particularly to explain the simulated federated setup.
   - **Clean Up Resources**: Close any open files, and free up memory by deleting large data structures that are no longer needed.

### Summary:
1. **Simulate a federated environment** by isolating each site's data and processing it independently.
2. **Perform local site-specific regression** as if each site were an independent node.
3. **Aggregate results** centrally to simulate the role of a federated server.
4. **Compile and output the final results** using the defined dataclasses.
5. **Optionally, simulate federated communication** and handle errors in a decentralized manner.
